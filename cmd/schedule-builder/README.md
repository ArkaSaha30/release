# Schedule Builder

This simple tool has the objective to parse and update the following YAML files
located in [k/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website):

- https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/main/data/releases/schedule.yaml
- https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/main/data/releases/eol.yaml

Those show the scheduled and past patch releases of the current Kubernetes
Release cycle as well as Kubernetes Release Cycles schedules in machine readable
format.

## Install

The simplest way to install the `schedule-builder` CLI is via `go install`:

```
$ go install k8s.io/release/cmd/schedule-builder@latest
```

This will install `schedule-builder` to `$(go env GOPATH)/bin/schedule-builder`.

Also if you have the `kubernetes/release` cloned you can run the `make release-tools` to build all the tools.

## Usage

Assuming you have cloned the `k/website` and `k/release` repositories, like:

```
.
+-- k8s.io
|   +-- release
|   +-- website
```

### Updating `schedule.yaml` and `eol.yaml`

To update both files, run:

```bash
schedule-builder -uc ../website/data/releases/schedule.yaml -e ../website/data/releases/eol.yaml
```

The output should look similar to this:

```
INFO Validating options
INFO Reading schedule file: ../website/data/releases/schedule.yaml
INFO Parsing schedule
INFO Updating schedule
INFO Using existing upcoming release for 2024-05-14
INFO Using existing upcoming release for 2024-06-11
INFO Using existing upcoming release for 2024-07-09
INFO Got 3 new upcoming releases, not adding any more
INFO Writing end of life branches: ../website/data/releases/eol.yaml
INFO Wrote schedule YAML to: ../website/data/releases/schedule.yaml
```

You can now propose the changeset as a new k/website PR for further review.

### For Patch Release Schedule

```bash
schedule-builder --config-path ../website/data/releases/schedule.yaml --type patch
```

The output will be something similar to this

```

Also can save the schedule in a file, to do that, you can set the `--output-file` flag together with the filename.

```
$ schedule-builder --config-path ../website/data/releases/schedule.yaml --type patch --output-file my-schedule.md
```
